        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p style = "margin-bottom: 50px"></p>
        <p>Created in 6 hours by three first-time hackathon goers, Dark Noises v0.1 is a roguelike infinite terrain game, where you play as the Darkness, a black block. Your goal is to kill as many enemies as you can, acquiring life force to improve your ability of kill EVEN MORE stuff, eventually being able to fight the King of Life. As the game was just created, it does not include all of this functionality, but however, it does include:</p>
        <p>-Infinite Terrain</p>
        <p>-Random Terrain Generation</p>
        <p>-Simple Combat System</p>
        <p>-Currency and Battle Points</p>
        <p>-Nostalgic 8-bit like gauntlet</p>
