        <p>
We grow accustomed to the Dark,
When light is put away, 
As when the Neighbor holds the Lamp
To witness her Goodbye,
        </p>
A Moment, We uncertain step
For newness of the night, 
Then - fit our Vision to the Dark, 
And meet the Road, erect, 
<p>
And so of larger, Darknesses, 
Those Evenings of the Brain, 
When not a Moon disclose a sign,
Or Star, come out, within, 
        </p>
The Bravest, grope a little,
And sometimes hit a Tree
Directly in the Forehead, 
But as they learn to see, 
<p>
Either the Darkness alters, 
Or something in the sight
Adjusts itself to Midnight,
And Life steps almost straight.
        </p>
